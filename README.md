# probabilityTwoBoys

I wrote this program to test out something I heard on an old episode of the Skeptics Guide to the Galaxy podcast.

It goes something like this:

> - You meet a woman and find out she has two kids.
> - You ask if she has any boys, and she says yes.
>
> What is the probability that she has 2 boys?

They go on to say that there are apparently two valid answers, depending on how you interpret the information in the question.

This didn't seem right to me, so I wrote this program to calculate it "empirically".
However, I've obviously encoded my interpretation of the question into my code, so of course it agrees with me.

Anyway, to read further, there's a wikipedia page about this whole business: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_Girl_paradox>

## To build/run

If you have access to my cmaked-ez repository, simply point CMake at the CMakeLists.txt and configure, build, and run it.

Otherwise, it's just one main.cpp, so I'm sure you can work it out.
